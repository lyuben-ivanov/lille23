\description{
Euro Area monetary base monthly data from the European Central Bank measured in millions of Euros. The data covers the period from Feb 1999 to Oct 2023.
}
\details{
Base money consists of banknotes in circulation, the deposits that credit institutions are required to
hold in their current accounts with the Eurosystem in order to cover the minimum reserve requirement
(required central bank reserves) and credit institutionsâ€™ holdings of highly liquid deposits with the
Eurosystem over and beyond the level of required central bank reserves (excess central bank reserves
and recourse to the deposit facility). \href{https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/ebbox201706_07.en.pdf}{ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 6/2017 - Boxes}
