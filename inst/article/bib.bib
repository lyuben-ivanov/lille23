	abstract = {This article analyses the relationship between the documented momentum effect on the Bulgarian Stock Exchange and the cultural characteristics of Bulgarian society on the basis of the 6-Dimensions Culture Model by Hofstede. Derived are possible behavioural biases, that could cause investors to underreact to firm-specific information, resulting in short-term return predictability. Outlined are implications for the relation between the rising of momentum effect and low individualism index, as identified on the Bulgarian Stock Exchange (BSE).},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT This paper documents that strategies which buy stocks that have performed well in the past and sell stocks that have performed poorly in the past generate significant positive returns over 3-to 12-month holding periods. We find that the profitability of these strategies are not due to their systematic risk or to delayed stock price reactions to common factors. However, part of the abnormal returns generated in the first year after portfolio formation dissipates in the following two years. A similar pattern of returns around the earnings announcements of past winners and losers is also documented.},

@article{mizen08,
	abstract = {This paper discusses the events surrounding the 2007-08 credit crunch. It highlights the period of exceptional macrostability, the global savings glut, and financial innovation in mortgage-backed securities as the precursors to the crisis. The credit crunch itself occurred when house prices fell and subprime mortgage defaults increased. These events caused investors to reappraise the risks of high-yielding securities, bank failures, and sharp increases in the spreads on funds in interbank markets. The paper evaluates the actions of the authorities that provided liquidity to the markets and failing banks and indicates areas where improvements could be made. Similarly, it examines the regulation and supervision during this time and argues the need for changes to avoid future crises.},

@techreport{auerbach09,
	abstract = {We review the evidence on the practice and effects of discretionary fiscal policy, particularly in the context of recent efforts to stimulate the economy, reaching two main conclusions.  First, policy interventions have increased in this decade, pre-dating the 2009 stimulus.  Second, despite a large economic literature on the topic, the state of theory and evidence is not as "shovel ready" as one would like.  Although consumption and investment clearly respond to tax incentives and structural vector autoregressions show that lower taxes and higher government purchases can boost output, it is difficult to apply the findings in the current context, in part because multipliers and policy lags are likely to vary with economic conditions.  Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models can be adapted to address extreme economic conditions, but yield an extremely wide range of predicted impacts.  The experience from large downturns - the U.S. Great Depression and the Japanese Lost Decade - is illuminating, but provides little evidence about policy effectiveness because systematic and sustained fiscal interventions were not attempted in either case.},

@article{black86,
	abstract = {ABSTRACT The effects of noise on the world, and on our views of the world, are profound. Noise in the sense of a large number of small events is often a causal factor much more powerful than a small number of large events can be. Noise makes trading in financial markets possible, and thus allows us to observe prices for financial assets. Noise causes markets to be somewhat inefficient, but often prevents us from taking advantage of inefficiencies. Noise in the form of uncertainty about future tastes and technology by sector causes business cycles, and makes them highly resistant to improvement through government intervention. Noise in the form of expectations that need not follow rational rules causes inflation to be what it is, at least in the absence of a gold standard or fixed exchange rates. Noise in the form of uncertainty about what relative prices would be with other exchange rates makes us think incorrectly that changes in exchange rates or inflation rates cause changes in trade or investment flows or economic activity. Most generally, noise makes it very difficult to test either practical or academic theories about the way that financial or economic markets work. We are forced to act largely in the dark.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the most comprehensive and up-to-date panel data set of invoicing currency patterns in global trade. It provides data on the shares of exports and imports invoiced in US dollars, euros, and other currencies for 115 countries since 1990. The evidence from these data confirms findings from earlier research regarding the strong persistence in invoicing currency patterns and the globally dominant role of the US dollar. It also points to several novel facts, such as the increase in the use of the dollar and the euro for invoicing, and the use of the euro as a vehicle currency in parts of Africa. Exchange rate pass-through and trade elasticity estimations with these data confirm that countries invoicing more in dollars (euros) tend to experience greater dollar (euro) exchange rate pass-through to their import prices and higher sensitivity of their trade volumes to fluctuations in these exchange rates.},

Weekly data on coronavirus cases and deaths are employed alongside Oxford indices on each nation's stringency and government support intensity. The results are broken down both by month and by geographical region. The full sample results show that increased coronavirus cases exert the expected overall effect of worsening relative stock market performance, but with little consistent impact of rising deaths. There is some evidence of significantly negative stock market effects arising from lockdowns as reflected in the Oxford stringency index. There are also positive reactions to government support in March and December in the overall sample---combined with some additional pervasive effects seen in mid-2020 in Latin America.},

@article{canzoneri13,
	abstract = {What are the costs and benefits of the dollar's status as the key currency in the international monetary system? Here, we present a calibrated two country model in which all exports are invoiced in the key currency, and government bonds denominated in the key currency are held internationally to facilitate trade, and as official reserve assets. We show that the ``exorbitant privilege'' accruing to the key currency country comes from three sources: (1) a bond seigniorage that we estimate to be worth about a half a percent of consumption per period to the United States, (2) asymmetric responses to exogenous shocks that are worth an additional quarter of a percent of consumption per period, and (3) a macroeconomic hegemony in monetary and fiscal policy, reflecting the fact that the key currency's policy instruments are more potent. But, there is also an exorbitant risk to being the key currency country. We show that the costs of a potential dumping of key currency bonds are also substantial. Moreover, there appear to be no obvious monetary or fiscal policy responses that would lower the costs significantly.},

Standard asset pricing models make sense of this: during a recession, dividends are low and the marginal value of income is high, causing low asset prices. Here, I develop a simple model which shows that this is not true during a recession caused by consumption restrictions, such as those seen during the 2020 pandemic: the restrictions drive the marginal value of income down, and thereby drive asset prices up, to an extent that tends to overwhelm the effect of low dividends. This result holds even if investors misperceive the economic forces at work.},
